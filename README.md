# Wine-and-Dine
School project

This is my first project done with other people.
The task was to collect places from Google API.

What we did was to take a specific type of businesses and listed them. (Restaurants)
What you could to later was to review them in our application.
Interact with other people and read their reviews.

We tried to create a food and drink community for people who were like minded.
